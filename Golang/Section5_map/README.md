**NOTE FOR SECTION 5: MAP**

- Invalid receiver type map

- Why we might use a struct instead of a map or vice versa ?
**map** | **struct**
- All keys-values must be the same type | - Values can be of different type.

- Keys are indexed-we can iterate over them | - Keys don't support indexing.

- Reference type (mean: dont worry about pointer) | - Value type.

- Use to represent a collection of related properties | - Use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties.

- Don't need to know all the keys at compile time | - You need to know all the different fields at compile time.
